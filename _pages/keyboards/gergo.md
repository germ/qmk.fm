# Gergo!

Gergo is a 14x4 ortholinear, 50-key keyboard kit, made by [g Heavy Industries](http://gboards.ca). Supporting MX, Alps and Choc switches and with an onboard processor, it's one of the lowest profile QMK boards available at the moment. With fullsize mods and a thin profile, Gergo is a great addition to your desk or your bag!

## Gadgets
Gergo comes suited for gadgets to be added to the keyboard. Currently a 1u Trackball is available and others
are on the way! Modify your rules.mk to enable/disable specfic gadgets.

Or if you're impatient, build your own using the open source footprint available [on Github!](http://github.com/germ/germ-footprints).
